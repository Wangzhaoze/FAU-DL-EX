# README.md

This is my personal code implement for the programm exercise of FAU Deep Learning Course

Of course, you can also use this project as a reference for learning the foundation of deep learning, because the implementation of the basic framework of the neural network does not rely on any existing data packages such as pytorch or Tensorflow, which will help you lay a solid foundation in the entry stage.

Most importantly, please respect your professors, tutors, and other classmates. Hope you really understand it but not plagiarize the code, beacuse this will result in you not getting any points! I just hope this code will give you some ideas and hints when you get stuck, rather than wasting a whole day staring at a computer screen because of a tiny bug.

Have Fun!
